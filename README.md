## Roadmap

- The development of project is completed under features branch i.e, [features](https://github.com/MaheswarReddyI/Training/tree/Features)


- The testing of the program's is completed under testing branch i.e,[testing](https://github.com/MaheswarReddyI/Training/tree/testing)

## Features

The Project Azuga Training has codes for different applications like,
- [Linux-commands](https://github.com/MaheswarReddyI/Training/tree/Features)
The project contains programs that mimics some of the basic Linux-Commands like cat, wc, head, tail, sort, ls etc

- [Api-Calls](https://github.com/MaheswarReddyI/Training/tree/Features)
It is included with programs for major Api's GET methods to get the data from the Api's and use them to create the .csv and .json files. 

- [File-Formatting](https://github.com/MaheswarReddyI/Training/tree/Features)
The data from the Api's Call method stored in .csv and .json file are formatted to the .xml, .pdf, .html formats.

- [Charts Creation](https://github.com/MaheswarReddyI/Training/tree/Features)
The Api's data in the files are used to create the charts, i.e to visualize the properties of the Api. Bar chart, Pie Chart and Line Chart are created.

- [OOPs Concepts](https://github.com/MaheswarReddyI/Training/tree/Features)
OOps concepts like interface, methods, objects, classes, constructors, abstraction etc were also used in the java codes.

- [Zip And UnZip](https://github.com/MaheswarReddyI/Training/tree/Features)
The reports created from the Api calls and Formatters were zipped, unzipped and sent through the mail programatically using java language.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

bash
  git clone https://github.com/MaheswarReddyI/Training


Go to the project directory

bash
  cd my-project


Open the project in any IDE like (IntelliJ idea,Eclipse)

Then you can directly start working on the project




## Running Tests

To run tests, you have to write tests by your own or you can use automation tools like selenium in java.
